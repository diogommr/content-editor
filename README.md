# Vanilla JS WYSIWYG Content Editor (Alpha)

This project aims to create a fully open source Vanilla JS WYSIWYG content editor for CMS' that's easy to customize and use.

It's a hybrid between a block editor and a rich text editor. This allows for opportunities to grow the editor to include markdown support, for example.

A basic code editor based on CodeMirror is already integrated for the Code Block and the HTML Block. It features syntax highlighting, auto-close tags, matching tag highlighting, and more.

It's fully modular in order to make it easy to extend and customize.
